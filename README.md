## Overview

Dynamic pricing involves automatically adjusting prices in response to market demand, competition, time, and other variables. This system provides a scalable and customizable framework for building and testing dynamic pricing algorithms, suitable for e-commerce, retail, travel, and more.

## Features

- Data-driven pricing adjustment algorithms
- Integration with external data sources (e.g., market trends, competitor prices)
- Simulation and evaluation tools for pricing strategies
- Modular codebase for easy customization and extension

## Technologies Used

- Python (core logic and algorithms)
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
- Jupyter Notebook (analysis & prototyping)
- Additional tools/libraries as required

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Parvathaiah-art/Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy.git
    cd Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy
    ```
2. Install dependencies (example using pip):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- **Configure your data sources and parameters** in the relevant script or notebook.
- **Run the main module** (example):
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
- **Analyze the output** and adjust strategy parameters as needed.

Refer to the example notebooks or scripts in the repository for more details.
